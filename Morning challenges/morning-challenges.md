### Morning challenges

1. [Are they the same](https://www.codewars.com/kata/are-they-the-same/javascript)
2. [Dubstep](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551dc350bf4e526099000ae5)
3. Multiples
```js
// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

// Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

// Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

function solution(number){

}
// solution(10)
// => 23
```
4. 6174
```js
// Pick any four digit number and do the following:
// Rearrange the string of digits to form the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
// Take these two numbers and subtract the smaller number from the larger. 
// Suppose we choose the number 8082.
// 8820−0288=8532
// 8532−2358=6174
// 7641−1467=6174 
// It hits 6174 and then stops.
// Count also how many iterations loops are required to get to this point.
// Bonus points for recognizing what 6174 is.
```
5. Atomic blonde number 
```js
// // Atomic Blonde Number:
// a number is an atomic blonde number if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
// For example, 123 is an atomic blonde number, as the sum of its digits (1+2+3) is 6, which is equal to the product of its digits (1*2*3).
// Write a program to check if a number is an atomic blonde number or not. 
// For example:
// Input: 1412
// Output: true
// Input: 247
// Output: false
```
6. Count the vowels
```js
// Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
// We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels.
// The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

function getCount(str) {
    // do code to count vowels
    return vowelsCount
}

getCount("hello")
=> 2
```
7. Toggle class
```js
// write some html with an img that's centred on the page
// link the html to a js file
// in the js i want there to be an event listener when you click on the image
// within the callback in the event listener i want the image to toggle between a class that makes the image round (and then click again and it's back to the original rectangle)
```
